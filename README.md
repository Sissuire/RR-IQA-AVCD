This is an implementation of the algorithm for creating the Attended Visual Content Degradation based RR-IQA

**Please refer to the following papers**

> Jinjian Wu, Yongxu Liu, Leida Li, and Guangming Shi, "Attended Visual Content Degradation Based Reduced Reference Image Quality Assessment", IEEE Access, 2018. 

======================== **Usage** ==========================

**Run <code>demo.m</code>**

Note:

- Please ensure to install GBVS environment properly;

- This code can also create the result of [2], through modifying a little in <code>AVCD.m</code>. Details can be seen in line 70 and line 90.
